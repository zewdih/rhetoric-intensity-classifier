# Rhetoric Intensity Classifier (UC Berkeley NLP Project)

This project builds a multi-class sentiment classifier to detect the rhetorical tone of political speech segments, classifying them into four categories: Apathetic, Moderate, Strongly Worded, and Extreme.

## üß† What I Did
- Used TF-IDF vectorization and logistic regression to classify segments based on tone
- Tuned hyperparameters and preprocessing steps to achieve the second highest accuracy in my team
- Contributed to data cleaning, model training, and evaluation
- Explored real-time applications in platforms like Twitch to support healthier chat moderation

## üóÇ Project Files
- `model.ipynb` ‚Äì Notebook with preprocessing, model training, and evaluation
- `Annotation_Guide.pdf` ‚Äì Official annotation rubric used for labeling training data

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
Python, Scikit-learn, TF-IDF, NLTK, Jupyter Notebook

## ‚úçÔ∏è Inspiration
This project was completed as part of UC Berkeley‚Äôs INFO 159 course. It combines NLP classification with real-world annotation criteria to explore shifts in political rhetoric ‚Äî and potential extensions to streaming or social platforms.
